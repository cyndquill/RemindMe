RemindMe is a WIP Android reminder app with a focus on scheduling future reminders based on present reminders clear time.

## Contributing

The main Kotlin project files can be found at `app/src`, branching off into `main` for project files and
`test` for unit testing. This app is being developed using Android Studio with support for Android 7.0+ SDK.
Currently, I intend to work on this as a solo developer until it has the functionality I desire.
